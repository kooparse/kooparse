### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an idependant software engineer.

I love coding for mostly one reason: It gives me a limitless power to create whatever I have in my head. There is such a powerful feeling that comes from creating something out of nothing.

I am 200% on game dev right now. Working mostly by myself.
